## SlideFormer for Megatron-LM-FL

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This branch provides a Megatron Core + Transformer Engine implementation of
> the single-GPU layer-sliding training design introduced by
> [SlideFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.16428). It preserves SlideFormer's
> CPU-resident parameter, optimizer, and activation-offload design while
> adapting the execution engine, asynchronous scheduling, checkpointing, and
> fused-kernel policy from PyTorch + Hugging Face to Megatron-LM-FL + TE.
> The currently validated scope is single-GPU dense Qwen3-class training.

Implementation details, limitations, and the complete acceptance protocol are
available in the
[SlideFormer design and acceptance report](docs/user-guide/slideformer_megatron_fl.md).
The reference PyTorch implementation is available at
[RegiaYoung/SlideFormer](https://github.com/RegiaYoung/SlideFormer).

### Qwen3 single-GPU results

The figures below compare this Megatron-LM-FL implementation with the
SlideFormer PyTorch reference on the same Qwen3 checkpoints. Measurements use
BF16, sequence length 1024, batch sizes 1--64, three warmup steps, and ten
measured optimizer steps on one RTX 4090.

## About

This repository contains two components: **Megatron-LM** and **Megatron Core**.

**Megatron-LM** is a reference example that includes Megatron Core plus pre-configured training scripts. Best for research teams, learning distributed training, and quick experimentation.

**Megatron Core** is a composable library with GPU-optimized building blocks for custom training frameworks. It provides transformer building blocks, advanced parallelism strategies (TP, PP, DP, EP, CP), mixed precision support (FP16, BF16, FP8, FP4), and model architectures. Best for framework developers and ML engineers building custom training pipelines.

**[Megatron Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge)** provides bidirectional Hugging Face ↔ Megatron checkpoint conversion with production-ready recipes.

## Getting Started

**Install from PyPI:**

```bash
uv pip install megatron-core
```

**Or clone and install from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM.git
cd Megatron-LM
uv pip install -e .
```

> **Note:** Building from source can use a lot of memory. If the build runs out of memory, limit parallel compilation jobs by setting `MAX_JOBS` (e.g. `MAX_JOBS=4 uv pip install -e .`).

For NGC container setup and all installation options, see the **[Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/megatron-core/developer-guide/latest/get-started/install.html)**.

# Performance Benchmarking

For our latest performance benchmarking results, please refer to [NVIDIA Megatron Bridge Performance Summary](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/megatron-bridge/latest/performance-summary.html).

Our codebase efficiently trains models from 2B to 462B parameters across thousands of GPUs, achieving up to **47% Model FLOP Utilization (MFU)** on H100 clusters.

![Model table](images/model_table.png)

**Benchmark Configuration:**

- **Vocabulary size**: 131,072 tokens
- **Sequence length**: 4096 tokens
- **Model scaling**: Varied hidden size, attention heads, and layers to achieve target parameter counts
- **Communication optimizations**: Fine-grained overlapping with DP (`--overlap-grad-reduce`, `--overlap-param-gather`), TP (`--tp-comm-overlap`), and PP (enabled by default)

**Key Results:**

- **6144 H100 GPUs**: Successfully benchmarked 462B parameter model training
- **Superlinear scaling**: MFU increases from 41% to 47-48% with model size
- **End-to-end measurement**: Throughputs include all operations (data loading, optimizer steps, communication, logging)
- **Production ready**: Full training pipeline with checkpointing and fault tolerance
- *Note: Performance results measured without training to convergence*

## Weak Scaling Results

Our weak scaled results show superlinear scaling (MFU increases from 41% for the smallest model considered to 47-48% for the largest models); this is because larger GEMMs have higher arithmetic intensity and are consequently more efficient to execute.

![Weak scaling](images/weak_scaling.png)

## Strong Scaling Results

We also strong scaled the standard GPT-3 model (our version has slightly more than 175 billion parameters due to larger vocabulary size) from 96 H100 GPUs to 4608 GPUs, using the same batch size of 1152 sequences throughout. Communication becomes more exposed at larger scale, leading to a reduction in MFU from 47% to 42%.
